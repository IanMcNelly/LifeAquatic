This will initialize the Git submodules,\r\ndownload the deobfuscated Minecraft source, and setup IntelliJ project files\r\nfor you.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Eclipse, you can run `./gradlew eclipse` after running the\r\nsetup script to generate the Eclipse project files.\r\n\r\n#### \"select an mcp conf dir for the deobfuscator\"\r\n\r\nIf you see this window, navigate to `$HOME/.gradle/caches/minecraft/net/minecraftforge/forge/$FORGE_VERSION/unpacked/conf`\r\n\r\nDepending on the circumstances, you may not be able to select the `.gradle`\r\ndirectory because it is hidden. If that is the case, type the absolute path into\r\nthe path selection box.\r\n\r\nClick Select to save the setting. You shouldn't be prompted to select this again.\r\n\r\nThis is raised by CodeChickenCore, which is the support library for NEI.\r\n\r\n### Style\r\n\r\nCoding style is enforced by [ScalaStyle](http://www.scalastyle.org/). ScalaStyle\r\nis run against every commit as part of each [build](https://travis-ci.org/aergonaut/LifeAquatic).\r\n\r\nTo check style yourself, run `./gradlew scalaStye`.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Chris Fung\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
